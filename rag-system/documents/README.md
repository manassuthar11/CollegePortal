## ü§ñ How the RAG System Works

### 1. **Document Ingestion**
- Automatically scans all category folders
- Extracts text from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
- Performs intelligent text cleaning and preprocessing
- Creates smart chunks with sentence awareness

### 2. **Vector Processing**
- Generates semantic embeddings using SentenceTransformers
- Stores vectors in ChromaDB for fast similarity search
- Creates TF-IDF index for keyword matching
- Implements hybrid search combining both approaches

### 3. **Query Processing**
- Understands natural language questions
- Performs semantic and keyword searches
- Ranks results by relevance and confidence
- Generates context-aware responses using DistilBERT

### 4. **Response Generation**
- Synthesizes information from multiple documents
- Provides source attribution and confidence scores
- Handles multi-document context assembly
- Delivers accurate, contextual answers

## üì§ Adding New Documents

### Simple Process:
1. **Place documents** in the appropriate category folder
2. **Supported formats:** PDF, DOCX, TXT
3. **Automatic processing** - The system will detect and process new files
4. **Immediate availability** - New information becomes searchable instantly

### Best Practices:
- **Use descriptive filenames** (e.g., "BTech_CSE_Admission_Requirements_2024.pdf")
- **Organize by category** to improve search accuracy
- **Keep documents updated** by replacing old versions
- **Use clear, well-formatted text** for better extraction

### Manual Reprocessing:
If you need to force reprocessing of all documents:
- Visit: http://localhost:8000
- Click the reprocess button, or
- Send POST request to `/reprocess` endpoint

## üéØ Query Examples

The RAG system can answer questions like:

**Admissions:**
- "What are the eligibility criteria for B.Tech admission?"
- "When is the last date for application submission?"
- "What documents are required for admission?"

**Courses:**
- "Tell me about the Computer Science curriculum"
- "What subjects are taught in the first semester?"
- "Who are the faculty members in the Electronics department?"

**Fees:**
- "What is the fee structure for MBA program?"
- "Are there any scholarships available?"
- "How can I pay the semester fees?"

**Hostel:**
- "What are the hostel facilities available?"
- "How much does hostel accommodation cost?"
- "What are the hostel rules and regulations?"

**Placements:**
- "What is the placement record of the college?"
- "Which companies visit for campus recruitment?"
- "What training programs are available for placements?"

## üîß Technical Features
